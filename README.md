# Scrape

An Elixir package to scrape websites. This is an attempt to rewrite
[meteor-scrape](https://github.com/Anonyfox/meteor-scrape) from scratch,
leveraging the expressiveness and power of Elixir. Current features:

- can handle non-utf-8 sources.
- parse common websites
- parse RSS/Atom feeds

## Installation

Add `scrape` to your mixfile:

````Elixir
{:scrape, "~> 0.1"}
````

## Usage

````Elixir
# Feed scraping:
Scrape.feed "http://feeds.venturebeat.com/VentureBeat"
